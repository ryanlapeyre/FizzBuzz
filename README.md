# FizzBuzz
One of the many solutions to the FizzBuzz solution.
My answer was simple: have a series of flags (the if statements) be signalled when the case is appropriate. Then, have the opposite case / detect those that will not "Fizz" or "Buzz." I'm sure there are better solutions out there but this was the one I came up with ;)
